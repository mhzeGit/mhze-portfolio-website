   - Keyboard navigation support (arrow keys, escape)
   - Smooth transitions between assets

2. **Multiple Image Views**
   - View 4 different renders of each model: Render, Wireframe, Matcap, Base Color
   - Image type buttons at bottom of modal
   - Easy switching between different views

3. **Improved Filtering**
   - Smooth reorganization when filtering
   - Cards properly disappear and reappear
   - No broken layouts during filtering

4. **Consistent Background**
   - Fixed background consistency across entire page
   - Matches your main website perfectly

## 🎯 **Key Features:**

✅ **Professional Gallery Layout** - Cards adapt to all screen sizes
✅ **Smart Filtering System** - Filter by Characters, Props, Environments, Weapons
✅ **Enhanced Modal Popups** - Navigate between models without closing
✅ **Multiple Image Views** - Show render, wireframe, matcap, and base color versions
✅ **Sketchfab Integration** - Direct links to your portfolio
✅ **Keyboard Navigation** - Use arrow keys and escape in modal
✅ **Professional Styling** - Consistent with your website theme
✅ **Responsive Design** - Perfect on desktop, tablet, and mobile

## 📁 **Files Created/Updated:**
- `my-3d-assets.html` - Enhanced modal structure
- `css/3d-assets.css` - New navigation and image controls styling
- `js/3d-assets.js` - Navigation and image switching functionality
- `js/3d-assets-data.js` - Extended data structure for multiple images
- `3D-ASSETS-SETUP.md` - This updated guide

## 🖼️ **Adding Multiple Images for Each Asset**

### Image Types Supported:
- **Render** - Your main beauty shot (already exists as `image` property)
- **Wireframe** - Wireframe view showing topology
- **Matcap** - Material capture/clay render
- **Base Color** - Diffuse/albedo textures only

### File Structure:
```
assets/3D-Assets/
├── asset-name-render.jpg      (main beauty shot)
├── asset-name-wireframe.jpg   (wireframe view)
├── asset-name-matcap.jpg      (matcap/clay render)
└── asset-name-basecolor.jpg   (base color/diffuse only)
```

### Data Structure:
```javascript
'your-asset-id': {
  // ... other properties
  image: './assets/3D-Assets/asset-render.jpg', // Main thumbnail
  images: {
    render: './assets/3D-Assets/asset-render.jpg',
    wireframe: './assets/3D-Assets/asset-wireframe.jpg',
    matcap: './assets/3D-Assets/asset-matcap.jpg',
    basecolor: './assets/3D-Assets/asset-basecolor.jpg'
  },
  // ... rest of properties
}
```

## 🎮 **Navigation Features:**

### Modal Navigation:
- **Left Arrow (←)** - Previous model
- **Right Arrow (→)** - Next model
- **Escape** - Close modal
- **Click outside** - Close modal

### Image View Controls:
- **Render** - Main beauty shot
- **Wireframe** - Topology view
- **Matcap** - Clay/matcap render
- **Base Color** - Diffuse textures only

## 🎨 **Recommended Image Specifications:**

### For Each Asset, Create 4 Images:

1. **Render (Beauty Shot)**
   - Size: 1200x900px or 1600x1200px
   - High-quality final render with lighting and materials
   - This is your main showcase image

2. **Wireframe**
   - Size: 1200x900px
   - Show the mesh topology clearly
   - Dark background with bright wireframe lines
   - Good for showcasing modeling quality

3. **Matcap/Clay Render**
   - Size: 1200x900px
   - Neutral gray material or matcap
   - Shows form and silhouette clearly
   - Good for demonstrating shape design

4. **Base Color**
   - Size: 1200x900px
   - Diffuse/albedo textures only
   - No lighting effects, just flat texture colors
   - Shows texture artwork quality

## 📝 **Quick Setup Steps:**

1. **Prepare Your Images** (4 per asset as described above)
2. **Add Images** to `assets/3D-Assets/` folder
3. **Update Asset Data** in `js/3d-assets-data.js`:
   ```javascript
   'your-asset': {
     // ... existing properties
     images: {
       render: './assets/3D-Assets/your-asset-render.jpg',
       wireframe: './assets/3D-Assets/your-asset-wireframe.jpg',
       matcap: './assets/3D-Assets/your-asset-matcap.jpg',
       basecolor: './assets/3D-Assets/your-asset-basecolor.jpg'
     }
   }
   ```
4. **Test the page** - Click assets and try navigation/image switching

## 🔥 **Pro Tips:**

### For Image Creation:
- Keep consistent lighting across render shots
- Use the same camera angle for all 4 views when possible
- Make wireframes visible against dark backgrounds
- Ensure base color images show texture detail clearly

### For Navigation:
- Modal navigation respects current filter (only shows filtered assets)
- If only 1 asset matches filter, arrows will be disabled
- Navigation loops (last asset → first asset)

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist:**
- ✅ All 4 image types display correctly
- ✅ Arrow navigation works between assets
- ✅ Keyboard navigation functions
- ✅ Filtering reorganizes cards smoothly
- ✅ Mobile responsive on all devices
- ✅ Image controls work on touch devices
- ✅ Background is consistent throughout page

The page now provides a professional, interactive showcase for your 3D assets with smooth navigation and multiple viewing modes!
