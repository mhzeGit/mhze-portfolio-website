                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This farming simulation game reimagines agricultural gameplay through innovative soil mechanics and realistic plant growth systems. Unlike traditional farming games that treat soil as simple tiles, this project features a dynamic underground ecosystem where every action has consequences for the health and productivity of your farm.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The core innovation lies in the multi-layered soil system where players must understand and manage soil composition, drainage, nutrient levels, and root development. Each plant species has unique requirements and growth patterns that interact realistically with the underground environment.</p>

                <p>Players engage in deep agricultural planning, considering crop rotation, companion planting, and seasonal changes. The game rewards understanding of real farming principles while maintaining the relaxing, meditative qualities that make farming simulations appealing to a broad audience.</p>

                <h2>Development Challenges & Solutions</h2>
                <p>Creating a realistic soil simulation while maintaining game performance required innovative approaches to data management and visualization. The challenge was representing complex underground systems in an intuitive, visually appealing way that doesn't overwhelm players.</p>

                <div class="project-image-card right">
                    <img src="./assets/my-work-content/farming-game-ui-design.webp" alt="Farming Game UI Design" />
                    <p class="image-caption">UI design showing soil analysis tools and underground visualization</p>
                </div>

                <p>I developed a custom cellular automata system to simulate soil conditions and water flow efficiently. The visual representation uses layered transparency and particle effects to show underground activity without cluttering the main farming interface. Players can toggle between surface view and cross-section analysis modes.</p>

                <p>Balancing realism with accessibility was another major challenge. The game includes an adaptive difficulty system that gradually introduces complex mechanics, allowing casual players to enjoy basic farming while providing depth for those interested in agricultural simulation.</p>

                <blockquote class="development-quote">
                    "The breakthrough moment came when I realized that soil should be as important a character as the plants themselves. Once I started thinking of dirt as a living system with its own needs and behaviors, everything clicked into place."

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Technical Architecture</h2>
                <p>The game utilizes a custom grid-based simulation engine built on Unity's Job System for efficient parallel processing of soil calculations. Each soil cell maintains multiple data layers including moisture, nutrients, pH levels, organic matter, and compaction values that update in real-time.</p>
