            <!-- Development Process Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Development Journey</h2>
                <p>The development of Blah Blah Family began with a simple concept: what if a horror game focused more
                    on the uncomfortable dynamics of family life rather than traditional monster encounters? This idea
                    evolved into a full-fledged game over the course of several months.</p>

                <div class="project-image-card right">
                    <img src="../assets/my-work-content/blah-blah-family/blah-blah-family-game-thumbnail.webp"
                        alt="Blah Blah Family Concept Art" />
                    <p class="image-caption">Early concept art exploring the family's character designs</p>
                </div>

                <p>One of the biggest challenges was balancing the horror elements with the cartoonish art style. I
                    wanted to create something that felt approachable but could quickly shift into deeply unsettling
                    territory. This required careful attention to lighting, animation timing, and facial expressions to
                    convey the dual nature of the family members.</p>

                <p>The dialogue system went through multiple iterations before I settled on the current approach.
                    Initially, I experimented with more traditional branching conversations, but found that a more
                    dynamic system where family members react to your presence and actions created a more immersive
                    experience.</p>

                <blockquote class="development-quote">
                    "The most rewarding aspect of developing this game was seeing players genuinely unsettled by moments
                    that weren't traditionally 'scary' - just deeply uncomfortable family interactions that felt too
                    real."

            <!-- Technical Details Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
                <p>Blah Blah Family was built using Unity Engine, leveraging its flexibility for both 3D environments
                    and 2D UI elements. The game employs a custom dialogue system that tracks relationship dynamics
                    between characters, influencing how they respond to the player's presence.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The lighting system plays a crucial role in the game's atmosphere. I implemented a dynamic lighting
                    setup that subtly changes based on the family's mood and the player's actions, using warm colors for
                    false comfort and cool, harsh lighting for moments of revelation.</p>

                <h2>Reception & Impact</h2>
                <p>Since its release, Blah Blah Family has garnered attention from horror game enthusiasts and content
                    creators alike. The game's unique approach to horror through family dynamics has sparked discussions
                    about the nature of fear in interactive media.</p>

                <p>Players particularly praised the game's ability to create tension without relying on cheap scares,
                    with many noting how the family's interactions felt disturbingly realistic. This feedback has
                    influenced my approach to subsequent horror projects, reinforcing the value of psychological depth
                    over surface-level frights.</p>
