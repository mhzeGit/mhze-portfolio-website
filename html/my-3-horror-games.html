            <!-- Development Philosophy Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Design for Content Creation</h2>
                <p>While creating genuinely scary experiences, I recognized early on that modern horror games live or die by their "shareability." Each game was designed with specific moments that would create strong reactions - whether fear, laughter, or surprise.</p>

                <div class="project-image-card right">
                    <img src="./assets/my-work-content/horror-games-reaction-moments.webp" alt="Popular Reaction Moments" />
                    <p class="image-caption">Screenshots of the most reacted-to moments across all three games</p>
                </div>

                <blockquote class="development-quote">
                    "I learned that the best horror games for content creation aren't just scary - they're conversational. They give streamers something to talk about, react to, and share with their audiences."
                </blockquote>

                <p>The success taught me valuable lessons about game design in the age of streaming. Players don't just want to be scared; they want to be part of a shared experience that they can discuss, share, and build communities around.</p>

            <!-- Technical Development Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
                <p>All three games were built using Unity Engine with a focus on rapid prototyping and iteration. The development approach prioritized getting playable builds into content creators' hands quickly to gather feedback and generate buzz.</p>

                <div class="tech-stack-showcase">
                    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
                    <div class="tech-stack">
                        <span class="tech-tag">Unity 3D</span>
                        <span class="tech-tag">C# Scripting</span>
                        <span class="tech-tag">Blender</span>
                        <span class="tech-tag">Audacity</span>
                        <span class="tech-tag">Unity Cinemachine</span>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Each game utilized different technical approaches to create fear: dynamic lighting systems, procedural audio manipulation, and physics-based environmental interactions. The goal was creating systems that could surprise both players and content creators, leading to genuine reactions.</p>
