                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>Blah Blah Family is a horror adventure game that combines atmospheric storytelling with unique gameplay mechanics. Set in a mysterious household, players must navigate through increasingly unsettling situations while uncovering the dark secrets that lurk beneath the surface of this seemingly ordinary family.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The game features a distinctive art style that blends cartoonish character designs with eerie atmospheric elements, creating a unique visual identity that sets it apart from traditional horror games. This stylistic choice allows for both moments of dark humor and genuine terror, keeping players constantly on edge about what might happen next.</p>

                <p>What makes Blah Blah Family special is its focus on psychological horror rather than jump scares. The game builds tension through environmental storytelling, subtle audio cues, and the gradual revelation of the family's disturbing dynamics.</p>

            <!-- Development Process Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Development Journey</h2>
                <p>The development of Blah Blah Family began with a simple concept: what if a horror game focused more on the uncomfortable dynamics of family life rather than traditional monster encounters? This idea evolved into a full-fledged game over the course of several months.</p>

                <div class="project-image-card right">
                    <img src="./assets/my-work-content/blah-blah-family-concept-art.webp" alt="Blah Blah Family Concept Art" />
                    <p class="image-caption">Early concept art exploring the family's character designs</p>
                </div>

                <p>One of the biggest challenges was balancing the horror elements with the cartoonish art style. I wanted to create something that felt approachable but could quickly shift into deeply unsettling territory. This required careful attention to lighting, animation timing, and facial expressions to convey the dual nature of the family members.</p>

                <p>The dialogue system went through multiple iterations before I settled on the current approach. Initially, I experimented with more traditional branching conversations, but found that a more dynamic system where family members react to your presence and actions created a more immersive experience.</p>

                <blockquote class="development-quote">
                    "The most rewarding aspect of developing this game was seeing players genuinely unsettled by moments that weren't traditionally 'scary' - just deeply uncomfortable family interactions that felt too real."

            <!-- Technical Details Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
                <p>Blah Blah Family was built using Unity Engine, leveraging its flexibility for both 3D environments and 2D UI elements. The game employs a custom dialogue system that tracks relationship dynamics between characters, influencing how they respond to the player's presence.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The lighting system plays a crucial role in the game's atmosphere. I implemented a dynamic lighting setup that subtly changes based on the family's mood and the player's actions, using warm colors for false comfort and cool, harsh lighting for moments of revelation.</p>
