            <!-- Development Philosophy Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Design for Content Creation</h2>
                <p>While creating genuinely scary experiences, I recognized early on that modern horror games live or die by their "shareability." Each game was designed with specific moments that would create strong reactions - whether fear, laughter, or surprise.</p>

                <div class="project-image-card right">
                    <img src="./assets/my-work-content/horror-games-reaction-moments.webp" alt="Popular Reaction Moments" />
                    <p class="image-caption">Screenshots of the most reacted-to moments across all three games</p>
                </div>

                <blockquote class="development-quote">
                    "I learned that the best horror games for content creation aren't just scary - they're conversational. They give streamers something to talk about, react to, and share with their audiences."
                </blockquote>

                <p>The success taught me valuable lessons about game design in the age of streaming. Players don't just want to be scared; they want to be part of a shared experience that they can discuss, share, and build communities around.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Technical Development Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
                <p>All three games were built using Unity Engine with a focus on rapid prototyping and iteration. The development approach prioritized getting playable builds into content creators' hands quickly to gather feedback and generate buzz.</p>

                <div class="tech-stack-showcase">
                    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
                    <div class="tech-stack">
                        <span class="tech-tag">Unity 3D</span>
                        <span class="tech-tag">C# Scripting</span>
                        <span class="tech-tag">Blender</span>
                        <span class="tech-tag">Audacity</span>
                        <span class="tech-tag">Unity Cinemachine</span>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Each game utilized different technical approaches to create fear: dynamic lighting systems, procedural audio manipulation, and physics-based environmental interactions. The goal was creating systems that could surprise both players and content creators, leading to genuine reactions.</p>

            <!-- Legacy & Impact Section -->

                <h2>Legacy & Community Impact</h2>
                <p>Beyond their entertainment value, these three horror games demonstrated the power of indie developers to create viral content that resonates with global audiences. The success opened doors to collaborations with other developers and content creators.</p>
