                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>Slime Defence is a tower defense game that reimagines the classic genre through the lens of colorful, gelatinous creatures. Players command an army of defensive slimes, each with unique abilities and strategic advantages, to protect their territory from waves of invading enemies.</p>

                    <p class="image-caption">Early gameplay showing slime tower placement and enemy waves</p>
                </div>

                <p>What sets Slime Defence apart from traditional tower defense games is its dynamic slime fusion system. Players can combine different types of slimes to create powerful hybrid defenders with combined abilities, adding a puzzle-like element to the strategic planning required for each level.</p>

                <p>The game features vibrant, hand-crafted environments where each slime type feels alive and responsive. From the bouncy Green Slimes that knock enemies backward to the acidic Purple Slimes that deal damage over time, each defender has a distinct personality and strategic role.</p>

            <!-- Design Philosophy Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
                <p>The core design philosophy behind Slime Defence centers on making strategic complexity accessible through intuitive, visual feedback. Every slime's ability is immediately understandable through its appearance and animation, reducing the learning curve while maintaining deep strategic gameplay.</p>

                <div class="project-image-card right">
                    <img src="./assets/my-work-content/slime-defence-concept-art.webp" alt="Slime Defence Concept Art" />
                    <p class="image-caption">Concept art showcasing different slime types and their unique characteristics</p>
                </div>

                <p>I wanted to create a tower defense game that felt fresh and approachable while still offering the depth that strategy enthusiasts crave. The slime theme allows for creative interpretations of traditional tower defense mechanics - for example, ice slimes that slow enemies can also create temporary bridges, adding a spatial puzzle element to the strategy.</p>

                <p>The fusion system emerged from the idea that players should be rewarded for experimentation. Rather than simply upgrading towers in linear progression, players discover new combinations through trial and error, creating moments of genuine discovery and personal strategy development.</p>

                <blockquote class="development-quote">
                    "I wanted every slime to feel like it has its own personality, not just a different damage number. When players see their Electric Slime zapping between enemies or their Shield Slime bouncing attacks back, the strategy becomes visceral and engaging."
                </blockquote>

            <!-- Technical Implementation Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
                <p>Slime Defence is built using Unity's 2D systems, utilizing a modular component architecture that allows for easy expansion of slime types and abilities. The fusion system is implemented through a scriptable object framework that enables designers to create new combinations without programming knowledge.</p>

                <p>The visual effects system uses Unity's Particle System extensively to create the gooey, satisfying animations that make each slime feel alive. Custom shaders handle the slime transparency and color blending effects that are crucial for communicating different slime types and fusion states to players.</p>

            <!-- Art and Animation Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Visual Design & Animation</h2>
                <p>The art style of Slime Defence draws inspiration from both retro pixel art and modern fluid animations. Each slime is hand-animated using traditional frame-by-frame techniques to achieve the bouncy, organic feel that makes them engaging to watch and interact with.</p>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Color plays a crucial role in the game's accessibility - each slime type has a distinct color palette that remains consistent across all fusion combinations, allowing players to quickly identify their defenders' capabilities even in the heat of battle. The environment art uses a complementary palette that makes the slimes pop visually while maintaining a cohesive aesthetic.</p>
